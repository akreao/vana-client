# release/fetch-ci-builds.sh downloaded (Windows always; Linux aarch64 and macOS when present), each with its .sig. VERSION must be the
# crate's version (crates/vana-client/Cargo.toml), newer than the last release: clients offer the update when the tag
# is newer and its signature checks against release/signing-key.pub, built in.
# The private key: VANA_SIGNING_KEY, or ~/.config/vana-client-release/signing-key.pem (Ed25519; never in the repo).
