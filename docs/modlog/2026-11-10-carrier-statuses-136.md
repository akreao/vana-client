## Carrier statuses 0x1a..0x1f, GroundMode, and the feet points (2026-11-10)

<!-- dll-build: 30261102_0 -->

Modlog-gaps item 136 ("Ground tilt: writers of +0x128 bit 14 and +0x120 bit 20; statuses 0x1a / 0x1b / 0x1d / 0x1e;
whether vt+0x1c4's bones include +0x998; long bodies' no-roll and scale overshoot"). The functions named below have
the same addresses in 30261006_0.

- Already answered: the writers of +0x128 bit 14 (HackMove) and +0x120 bit 20 (GroundFlag), MODLOG "GroundFlag and
  HackMove stop the ground snap and tilt".
- Statuses 0x1a..0x1f are a carrier and its riders, two sets (FUN_1008cd90, the entity update, called for index 0 up
  by FUN_10096640 through FUN_1008e9a0):
  - state in force (+0x170) 0x1a / 0x1b (set A) or 0x1d / 0x1e (set B): when the entity has a model that is an
    XiDoorActor (FUN_1002c8f0 on 0x10330d4c; lifts and ships are not), p = its part 0 translation (drawobj +0x624,
    what scheduler op 0x0c moves, FUN_10043d00 -> FUN_100acea0); step = p - last p, last p = p, in globals
    (A DAT_10486bb8 / DAT_10486bc8, B DAT_10486b98 / DAT_10486ba8) that nothing else writes or clears; +0x120 bit 21
    is set. For any other actor p is an unset stack vector. These are also the door states that open (0x1a / 0x1d)
    and close (0x1b / 0x1e), MODLOG "Doors".
  - bound actors (+0x120 bit 7) return before the rider part. Any other actor in status 0x1c (set A) or 0x1f (set B),
    after its slide step: position += the set's step, bit 21 set, the model placed at once (FUN_10092c20), and the
    server place +0x24 and the move start +0x44 = the new position. This runs with and without a model.
  - bit 21 is cleared at the top of the update for unbound actors, so it holds exactly while the status does.
- FUN_100983f0 (c2s 0x015) returns at once while our status in force is 0x1c or 0x1f: no position goes out. Its
  byte @0x15: bit 0 = +0x124 bit 18 (TargetMode), bit 1 = +0x124 bit 19 (RunMode), bit 2 GroundMode = +0x128 bit 14
  | +0x120 bit 21 | +0x120 bit 20, the three bits FUN_10084640 tests. @0x18 = FUN_100dc120() (TimeNow).
- FUN_10084640 itself is called only by FUN_100cbde0 (both tilt sites).
- Who sets the statuses: only the server's status byte (0x00D / 0x00E @0x1f, 0x037). Census
  `dat::event::status_census::event_status_census` over every zone's event code: op 0x4f (+0x174 = val + 0x12) is
  used 22 times with 0x12, 0x13, 0x15, 0x17, 0x19 only; op 0xac sub 1 with 0, 1, 2, 6, 0x22, 0x26, 0x27, 0x29, 0x2b,
  0x2f, 0x42, 0x44; op 0xac sub 0 (+0x16c) never; no operand is a variable. LSB names none of 0x1a..0x1f in a
  script or table.
- Event status ops: 0x4c / 0x4d / 0x4f / 0x8e / 0x8f write +0x174 on whatever actor runs them and skip while its
  +0x120 bit 2 is set; op 0xac sub 1 has no such test (asm 0x100bb1ee..0x100bb215).
- vt+0x1c4 on the skeleton classes (FUN_100d4560 -> FUN_1002c400 -> FUN_1002a780) reads the model's bone matrices
  (model +0x14 + bone x 0x40) and needs model +0x30 bit 4. FUN_100cbde0 poses them with FUN_1002c2d0(root = actor
  +0x998), the matrix the tilt wrote. So the feet points of FUN_100a4d10 are the last drawn pose on the last drawn
  world matrix, tilt included; before the first pose the call fails.
- Ours:
  - client/carrier.rs: `Carriers` (the two sets, the frame's publishes by index so an actor before its carrier
    still takes last frame's step), `carrier::update` after `doors::update`, the step added to riders in the entity
    loop after the slide (also after a push or an op 0x6e step) with the slide goal moved along, and to our own
    position. A carrier that is not a door publishes nothing (retail: undefined).
  - Not retail: while the rider status holds, riders skip the static floor snap and we skip gravity and the floor
    follow (input moves keep their height). Retail's floor ray also meets door models (FUN_1017a660), so a rider
    stands on its carrier there; ours has no door floors, and the static floor would take back a rising carrier's lift.
  - bit 21 from these statuses stops the ground tilt and the event ground snaps (`carrier::no_ground`).
  - c2s 0x015: GroundMode is sent (HackMove, GroundFlag, op 0x33's bit, the carrier statuses); no 0x015 while our
    status in force is 0x1c / 0x1f. LSB reads neither.
  - the door status ops honour the +0x120 bit 2 lock and write the one event status (doors and characters); op 0xac
    sub 1 no longer tests the lock.
  - the feet normal uses the posed points of the last drawn frame through that frame's matrix (`Actor.feet`); such
    models (info[0] == info[2] == 2) now always pose on the CPU. Before: the rest pose through this frame's
    untilted matrix.
- Not built: TargetMode / RunMode (+0x124 bits 18 / 19, writers not traced) and TimeNow in c2s 0x015; FUN_100ae3f0's
  copy of +0x174 into +0x16c / +0x170 at the event's end for entities with +0x138 bit 31 (op 0xac sub 2).
- Still open (footage only): the across-slope no-roll of long bodies and the scale overshoot.
- Not checked live: no server sends these statuses (LSB never does), and no server ran in this session.
